# svelte-loader-hot

This is a copy of official [svelte-loader](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader) with added HMR support.

HMR is not officially supported by Svelte 3 yet. Progress can be tracked in [this issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/3632).

Meanwhile, please report your issues regarding HMR (with Webpack) in this project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/rixo/svelte-loader-hot/issues).

**:warning: Experimental :warning:**

This HMR implementation relies on Svelte's private & non documented API. This means that it can stop working with any new version of Svelte.

**Update 2020-02-24** We're [making progress](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/3822) :)

## Templates

To quickly bootstrap a new project, or for example purpose, you can use the following templates. They are copies of the official templates, with the bare minimum added to support HMR with this plugin.

- [svelte-template-webpack-hot](https://github.com/rixo/svelte-template-webpack-hot): hot version of the official Svelte template for Webpack.

- [sapper-template-hot#webpack](https://github.com/rixo/sapper-template-hot/tree/webpack): Sapper + Webpack template with HMR.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev svelte-loader-hot
```

## Usage

This plugin can be used as a drop-in replacement for `svelte-loader`. It aims to remain as close to the official plugin as possible. Please refer to [official docs](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader) for general usage of the plugin. For HMR specific stuff, see bellow.

Configure inside your `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
// required for emitting css through webpack-virtual-modules plugin
const SveltePlugin = require('svelte-loader-hot').plugin;

module.exports = {
  ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      ...
      {
        test: /\.(html|svelte)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'svelte-loader-hot',
          options: {
            // NOTE Svelte's dev mode MUST be enabled for HMR to work
            // -- in a real config, you'd probably set it to false for prod build,
            //    based on a env variable or so
            dev: true,
          
            // NOTE emitCss: true is currently not supported with HMR
            emitCss: false,
            // Enable HMR
            hotReload: true, // Default: false
            // Extra HMR options
            hotOptions: {
              // Prevent preserving local component state
              noPreserveState: false,

              // If this string appears anywhere in your component's code, then local
              // state won't be preserved, even when noPreserveState is false
              noPreserveStateKey: '@!hmr',

              // Prevent doing a full reload on next HMR update after fatal error
              noReload: false,

              // Try to recover after runtime errors in component init
              optimistic: false,

              // --- Advanced ---

              // Prevent adding an HMR accept handler to components with 
              // accessors option to true, or to components with named exports
              // (from <script context="module">). This have the effect of
              // recreating the consumer of those components, instead of the
              // component themselves, on HMR updates. This might be needed to
              // reflect changes to accessors / named exports in the parents,
              // depending on how you use them.
              acceptAccessors: true,
              acceptNamedExports: true,
            }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        // required to prevent errors from Svelte on Webpack 5+
        test: /svelte\/.*\.mjs$/,
        resolve: {
          fullySpecified: false
        }
      }
      ...
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
    new SveltePlugin(),
    ...
  ]
}
```

You also need to add the [HotModuleReplacementPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/hot-module-replacement-plugin/). There are multiple ways to achieve this.

If you're using webpack-dev-server, you can just pass it the [`hot` option](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverhot) to add the plugin automatically.

Otherwise, you can add it to your webpack config directly:

```js
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
    ...
  ]
}
```
